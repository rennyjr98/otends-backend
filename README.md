## Process

First of all we need a account to can belong to a Farm, this farms are threads that contains two types
of threads Farmers and Incubators, Farms check every 12 hours if needs more Farmers, farmers check if 
an incubator needs a OThread and OThreads are our IA, this kind of object containts all the system 
need to train and predict data. The client doesn't need to know anything about Farm, Farmers and Incubators, just OThreads.

OThreads can be classifiers and historical recognition, on the first option, the system needs a input to predict data, and the other option just predict getting the data by date and check with current date, so automaticly get a prediction.

Also they can be private or public that anyone can use your OThread or maybe use it like input to their own OThread. The data to train can be get it from JSON file or from an API.
